  <h1>A Letter I Didn’t Know How To Write</h1>

  <p>
  I’m better at building things than saying things.
  So I built this.
  </p>

  <p>
  We weren’t perfect. We were messy, inconsistent, emotional,
  and sometimes scared of each other.
  </p>

  <p>
  But through all of it, you stayed.
  And even when I didn’t say it out loud,
  I noticed.
  </p>

  <p>
  This last year wasn’t about fixing everything.
  It was about choosing each other even when things felt quiet.
  </p>

  <p>
  I don’t take that lightly.
  I don’t take you lightly.
