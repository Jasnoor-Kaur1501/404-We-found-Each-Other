# 404-We-found-Each-Other
404: We Found Each Other is an interactive, terminal-style web experience that starts as a system error and slowly reveals a love story. Through scroll-based photo logs, system messages, and a final typed reveal, it reframes an on-and-off relationship as a system that failed, rebooted, and finally stabilized.
