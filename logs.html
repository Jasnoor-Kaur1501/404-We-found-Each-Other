    <h3>LOG_042 — Reconnected</h3>
    <p>
      We didn’t come back because everything suddenly made sense.
      We came back because even after the silence,
      you still felt familiar in a way no one else did.

    <h3>LOG_117 — Learning Curve</h3>
    <p>
      This phase wasn’t loud.  
      It was quiet, confusing, and uncomfortable.
      But it was honest.

    <h3>LOG_256 — Still Running</h3>
    <p>
      Somehow, after everything, we’re still here.
      And this time, it doesn’t feel accidental.
