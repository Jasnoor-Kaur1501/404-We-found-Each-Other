  <h1>Things We Survived</h1>

  <div class="block">
    <h3>Phase One</h3>
    <p>
      Everything was intense. Feelings moved faster than understanding.
      We loved loudly but listened quietly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h3>Phase Two</h3>
    <p>
      Distance crept in.
      Conversations got heavier.
      Silence started saying more than words.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">

    <h3>Phase Three</h3>
    <p>
      Trying again without pretending the past didn’t exist.
      Learning instead of restarting.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h3>Phase Four</h3>
    <p>
      One full year of consistency.
      No drama.
      Just showing up.
    </p>
